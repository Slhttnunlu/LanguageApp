# Description
- The application basically works as a matching game,
- You need to match 8 randomly ordered colours with each other in English-Turkish,
- When we make the correct selection, the relevant colour buttons disappear from the screen,
- There are also Animals, Numbers, Goods categories in the CatagoryActivity.xml file, but these parts are not coded yet.
- Since the working logic of the other categories will be the same as the codes from the MainActivity.java file, you can simply create it if you want to use it.
